### FINAL PROJECT runs between all the subjects. Each subject has its own requirements. This project is worth 30% of my final grades.The main aim is to make one website for all the the subjects.

## *****STEPS I FOLLOWED*****

1. Created rough ideas on website and discussed with professors.
2. Digital media, I clicked images and edited in photoshop.
3. Design and Image, first I designed logo for website.Then,I made logo of that in illustrator or layouts in photoshop.
4. Visual Communication, I made use of everything we did in class so far.
5. I created one repository and ```Add``` , ```commit``` ,```push``` in my dev.sk branch.
6. Then I did coding in ```HTML```, ```CSS``` for Multimedia Production(Justin Brunner).
7. Lastly, I just need to present in front of professors.

## Considerations
### Flex boxes are very important to use in coding and also students must have 7 photos clicked by theirselves.

## Prerequisities
### Make a website included all the ```Requirements``` of every professor. 

## Tips
### Make it simple as you can because simple things makes more sence and easy to understand as compare to complex design.
